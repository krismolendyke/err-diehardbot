Ya wanna know the secret of successful

Fists with your toes.

could bunk with him.

                HOLLY

whole time...Look, let's make this
easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's
not huge, but the kids would love to
have you at the house.

This is a Japanese company, you know?
They figure a married woman, she's on
the way out the door...

this one particular married woman,
she went out the door so fast there
was practically a jetwash...I mean,
talk about your wind chill factor...

take it --

                MCCLANE
No matter what it did to our marriage -- ?

My job and my title and my salary did
nothing to our marriage except change
your idea of what it should be.

                MCCLANE
Oh, here it comes.  One of those
'meaningful relationship conversations.'
I never should've let you get those
magazine subscriptions --
%
                HOLLY
You want to know my idea of a marriage?
It's a partnership where people help
each other over the rough spots --
console each other when there's a
down...and when there's an up, well,
hell, a little Goddamn applause or
an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.

I needed that, John.
